Installation
Prerequisites

    Python 3.9+

    Required Python packages:

        customtkinter

        psutil

Install dependencies

pip install customtkinter psutil

Additional Requirements by OS

    Windows: manage-bde available (built into Windows Pro/Enterprise editions).

    Linux: cryptsetup installed with root privileges.

    macOS: Uses fdesetup â€” run with appropriate permissions.

Usage

    Run the Python script:

python LS-MasterFormat.py

    Use the GUI to:

        Select a drive or all drives.

        Choose your operating system.

        Pick the desired file system.

        Select an encryption method.

        Click Format + Encrypt to start.

Important Notes

    This tool will erase data on the selected drives! Make sure you back up any important data before proceeding.

    Running the tool may require administrator/root privileges.

    FileVault encryption for external drives on macOS may require additional configuration; currently, it enables system disk encryption.

    Use "All Drives" option cautiously to avoid formatting critical drives.

    Tested on Windows 10/11, Ubuntu Linux, and macOS Monterey.

Troubleshooting

    If formatting fails on Windows, check drive readiness and admin privileges.

    On Linux, ensure cryptsetup is installed and you have sudo rights.

    On macOS, ensure you run with the right permissions and understand FileVault limitations.
