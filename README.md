## Overview

LS-MasterFormat is part of series of server tools called "LS project"
LS-MasterFormat is a cross-platform GUI application built with CustomTkinter that allows users to safely format and encrypt removable USB drives. The tool supports multiple file systems and encryption methods, including BitLocker (Windows), LUKS (Linux), and FileVault (macOS).

Designed for power users, system admins, and anyone needing quick, automated USB drive preparation with encryption.

## Important Notes

* **This tool will erase data on the selected drives!** Make sure you back up any important data before proceeding.
* Running the tool may require administrator/root privileges.
* FileVault encryption for external drives on macOS may require additional configuration; currently, it enables system disk encryption.
* Use "All Drives" option cautiously to avoid formatting critical drives.
* Tested on Windows 10/11, Ubuntu Linux, and macOS Monterey.

---

## Troubleshooting

* If formatting fails on Windows, check drive readiness and admin privileges.
* On Linux, ensure `cryptsetup` is installed and you have sudo rights.
* On macOS, ensure you run with the right permissions and understand FileVault limitations.
